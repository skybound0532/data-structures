    <p>Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? <br> I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. <br> It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... <br> He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. <br> The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. <br> He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. <br> Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. <br> It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.</p>
